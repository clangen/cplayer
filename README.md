# Overview

`cplayer` is a small, statically served album-based audio player for modern web browsers. You simply drop a build into a directory on your web server, create a `manifest.json` file that describes the album metadata and track URIs and you're done.

It looks something like this:

# Why?

I had the need to share some music I recorded with a couple other people, and didn't want to bother creating a SoundCloud account, uploading them to YouTube, or sending them via email. I just wanted to host my own music and provide a simple, lightweight web-based player for others to use to listen to the audio.
